# Branch Context

## 0.12-era proposal baseline

The 0.12-era work is the formal proposal baseline for grant-style acceptance
discussions. Do not use that historical baseline to describe the current
`main` branch state.

## nightly-0.23

`nightly-0.23` is the CellScript 0.23.0 release-candidate line. It has one
mandatory source-semantics epoch, `edition = "2026"`, plus an independently
resolved target/assurance/ABI/schema profile, and deliberately rejects
older package, lock, deployment, receipt, builder, and raw entry-witness
identities rather than migrating them. Treat the line as merge-ready only when
the edition/profile identity is consistent across compiler, metadata, WASM,
builders, initialized submodules, docs, and the `dev`, `ci`, and `backend`
gates. Treat it as a stable release only at the exact `v0.23.0` tag after the
full `release` gate passes.

## nightly-0.22

`nightly-0.22` is the active implementation line for the 0.22 type-and-set
theory roadmap. It begins from the integrated 0.21.1 `main` checkpoint. Treat
features as shipped only when parser, formatter, type checking, lowering,
metadata, LSP, tests, docs, and the matching gate agree; the branch name is not
production evidence by itself.

## main / nightly-0.21

`main` and `nightly-0.21` currently carry the 0.21 release-candidate
implementation checkpoint. This line includes the 0.21 compiler, metadata,
CLI, MCP, skill-pack, and builder-resolution work, but it is not a production
CKB release claim until the matching `ci`, backend, and release gates have
recorded passing evidence.

Use this line for 0.21 maintenance work. Keep P2 Template Merkleisation and
new observation syntax out of this line unless their parser, metadata,
backend, docs, and gate evidence are all promoted together.

## v0.20.0

`v0.20.0` is the latest stable release baseline before the 0.21 RC line. Use it
as the comparison point for 0.21 audits, metadata schema changes, and
compatibility notes. Be explicit when comparing against the tag ref
`refs/tags/v0.20.0`, because local branches may also be named `v0.20.0`.

## 0.16

0.16 is an audit-hardening preview. It is useful for tracing how earlier review
findings were handled, but it should not be treated as the current iCKB
differential-evidence branch.

## research/protocol-equivalence

`research/protocol-equivalence` is the 0.17 research and differential-evidence
branch. It moves the iCKB benchmark from model-only evidence into broad partial
CKB VM differential evidence for selected normalized fixtures.

Current active matrix counts:

- `DIFFERENTIAL_CKB_VM_EXECUTED`: 66
- `CELL_SCRIPT_CKB_VM_EXECUTED`: 14
- `ORIGINAL_ICKB_CKB_VM_EXECUTED`: 8
- `MODEL`: 0

The branch still keeps `equivalence_status = NOT_PROVEN` and
`production_equivalence_claim = false`. Do not describe it as production
equivalent until the gate has complete evidence-manifest closure and the
non-executable assumptions registry is empty.
