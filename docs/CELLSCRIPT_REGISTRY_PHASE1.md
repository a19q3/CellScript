# CellScript Registry: Artifact and Deployment Contract

**Status**: implemented public contract for the CellScript Registry. The
admission, verification, discovery, deployment-evidence, CLI, and website
surfaces described here are checked in on the current release line.

The source-package production slice is deployed. Generic artifact,
reproduction, deployment, and chain-index code is implemented, but a public
`on_chain_committed` claim additionally requires operators to deploy and pin
the canonical mainnet Registry Type Script, commitment custody Lock, and both
code CellDeps. Until all four configuration values are present and their Cells
are live with the required confirmation depth, commitment construction fails
closed and scheduled chain reconciliation remains disabled.

The Pudge Testnet Sandbox is a separate environment, not a network switch in
production. It has its own API, Postgres database, object volume, signing
origin, website build, wallet state, RPC identity, and testnet evidence.
Sandbox releases leave discovery after 72 hours and source objects are removed
after a further 24-hour grace period; Pudge chain history is unaffected.

The canonical `no_std` Script source, exact deployable ELF, CKB-VM tests,
reproducible Linux build recipe, builder image digest, and release identity are
tracked under `contracts/registry-type-script`. Only a Linux x86_64 rebuild is
treated as a byte reproduction; another host's Rust/LLVM output is reported but
never silently substituted for the deployable artifact. Its args bind the full
custody Lock Script hash and every lifecycle transition must consume a Cell
under that Lock; an unrelated sender cannot create a trusted commitment merely
by locking an output to the Registry address.

The Registry indexes CKB ecosystem artifacts. A coordinate is
`namespace/name`; a release adds an immutable version. The coordinate does not
imply that the object is a CellScript dependency, executable, deployed Script,
or reusable source library. Those meanings are explicit in the artifact
descriptor and in three independent state axes.

The production boundary and operator controls remain in
[`CELLSCRIPT_REGISTRY_PRODUCTION_BOUNDARY_ADR.md`](CELLSCRIPT_REGISTRY_PRODUCTION_BOUNDARY_ADR.md).

## One Public Model

Every artifact has this descriptor:

```json
{
  "kind": "deployable_contract",
  "profile": "ckb_executable",
  "consumption_mode": "deployment",
  "language": "rust"
}
```

The Registry accepts these kinds:

| Kind | Profile | Consumption | Required immutable objects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `source_library` | `cellscript_source` | `dependency` | CellScript source snapshot |
| `profile_library` | `cellscript_source` | `dependency` | CellScript source snapshot |
| `runtime_verifier` | `ckb_executable` | `tcb` | source, executable, ABI |
| `deployable_contract` | `ckb_executable` | `deployment` | source, executable, ABI |
| `reproducible_binary` | `reproducible_build` | `tcb` | source, executable, build recipe |
| `template` | `copy_material` | `copy` | source material |

`cellc install` deliberately accepts only the `cellscript_source` +
`dependency` contract. An executable, verifier, reproducible tool, or template
can be discovered and audited through the same Registry, but it cannot be
silently interpreted as a CellScript dependency.

There is one public route family: `/v1/artifacts`. The Registry does not expose
a second package route with a competing data shape.

## Independent States

Each release exposes three orthogonal states:

- `verification_status`: `pending`, `hash_bound`, `verified`, `evidence_required`, or
  `rejected`;
- `deployment_status`: `not_applicable`, `undeployed`, `deployed`, or
  `chain_verified`;
- `availability_status`: `active`, `deprecated`, `yanked`, or `quarantined`.

These states must not be collapsed into one lifecycle label. A reproducible
binary may be verified but have no deployment concept. A CKB executable may be
verified and still undeployed. A previously chain-verified release may later be
deprecated without rewriting its evidence.

`on_chain_committed` is a current-state claim, not a permanent badge. Scheduled
maintenance returns a spent commitment to `deployed` and a stale deployment to
`verification_status = verified` plus `deployment_status = undeployed`
(projected as `verified_build`), while retaining every accepted evidence record
for audit. Disabling the Registry Script configuration also clears current
commitment pointers because the service can no longer re-observe them.

## Artifact Identity

The Registry separates four questions:

1. **Coordinate identity**: which publisher-controlled name and release?
2. **Source identity**: which immutable source or input bytes?
3. **Build identity**: which executable, ABI, recipe, compiler, and metadata?
4. **Deployment identity**: which live mainnet Cell contains the executable?

Source and build identity come from immutable, hash-bound bundle objects.
Deployment identity is an additional signed evidence record; publishing an
executable never claims that it is already deployed.

For CKB executables, `artifact_hash` is the CKB Blake2b-256 hash of the
executable bytes. A deployment record must bind the same value as `data_hash`.
The Registry calls `get_live_cell` on the environment's configured CKB network
and verifies:

- the OutPoint is live;
- the returned Cell data hash equals the published executable hash;
- for `hash_type = type`, the returned Type Script hash equals `code_hash`;
- for data-hash variants, `code_hash` equals the executable data hash.

It also reads `get_transaction.tx_status` for the creation transaction,
requires `status = committed`, and uses that standard response's block hash for
minimum-confirmation checks. It does not depend on a proxy-specific
`get_live_cell.block_hash` field.

For `dep_type = dep_group`, the Registry decodes the live DepGroup Cell as the
canonical Molecule `OutPointVec`, loads its members, and requires a live member
whose code/data identity matches the published executable. The DepGroup
container bytes are never treated as executable code.

The production Registry accepts only CKB mainnet deployment records and exposes
no network selector. The isolated Pudge environment accepts only testnet
records and cannot promote them into production state.

## Publishing CellScript Dependencies

A normal CellScript package uses `Cell.toml` and the native publish path:

```bash
cellc package verify --json
cellc publish --dry-run
cellc publish --authorise  # interactive first publish
cellc publish              # later publishes with an active delegated key
```

Profile libraries use the same compiler-backed snapshot contract and declare
their distinct kind explicitly:

```bash
cellc publish --artifact-kind profile_library --dry-run
cellc publish --artifact-kind profile_library --authorise  # first publish
```

The verifier compiles the snapshot with the real CellScript compiler and
checks its canonical manifest, source hash, build identity, metadata, and
compatibility-profile identity. Publisher-supplied state is never treated as
verification evidence.

## Publishing Other Artifacts

Non-CellScript artifacts use `Artifact.toml` plus a bounded JSON bundle:

```toml
schema = "cellscript-registry-artifact"
namespace = "acme"
name = "vault-lock"
release = "1.0.0"
kind = "deployable_contract"
language = "rust"
bundle = "vault-lock.bundle.json"
description = "Mainnet vault lock Script"
repository = "https://github.com/acme/vault-lock"
keywords = ["lock", "vault"]
```

The referenced bundle carries a closed, typed profile contract. For a
deployable contract, canonicalize this object recursively by key and encode the
resulting JSON as the bundle's `manifest_json` string:

```json
{
  "schema": "cellscript-registry-profile-contract-v1",
  "artifact_kind": "deployable_contract",
  "profile": "ckb_executable",
  "build": {
    "target": "riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf",
    "toolchain": "rustc 1.97.1",
    "profile": "release",
    "source_revision": "<immutable revision>",
    "reproducible": false
  },
  "security": { "status": "review_required" },
  "ckb": {
    "vm_version": "2",
    "script_role": "lock",
    "hash_type": "data1",
    "dep_type": "code",
    "abi_hash": "<CKB Blake2b-256 of the ABI object>"
  }
}
```

The bundle has this shape:

```json
{
  "schema": "cellscript-registry-bundle",
  "namespace": "acme",
  "name": "vault-lock",
  "release": "1.0.0",
  "profile": "ckb_executable",
  "manifest_json": "<canonical cellscript-registry-profile-contract-v1 JSON>",
  "objects": [
    { "role": "source", "content_base64": "..." },
    { "role": "executable", "content_base64": "..." },
    { "role": "abi", "content_base64": "..." }
  ]
}
```

For `reproducible_binary`, use profile `reproducible_build` and replace `abi`
with `build_recipe`; its contract binds the environment, deterministic command,
recipe hash, and expected artifact hash. `runtime_verifier` additionally
requires `verifier_id`, `ipc_abi`, and the IPC ABI hash. For `template`, use
profile `copy_material`, include only `source`, and encode it as a
`cellscript-template-file-map-v1` whose relative paths, contents, and hashes are
authenticated. The CLI rejects unknown contract fields, missing or duplicate
roles, malformed values, unsafe copy paths, and hashes that do not bind the
immutable objects.

A `ckb_executable` may also set `build.reproducible = true`, include a
`build_recipe` object, and use the same `reproduction` contract. Deployment and
reproducibility are independent axes: the former is proven by a live mainnet
Cell, while the latter still needs reproducible-build evidence beyond a recipe
declaration.

When `security.status = "audited"`, the contract must include
`security.audit_report_hash` and the bundle must contain exactly one non-empty
`audit_report` object with that CKB Blake2b-256 hash. The status is still a
publisher declaration; the binding prevents the referenced report from being
swapped or omitted.

```bash
cellc publish --artifact-manifest Artifact.toml --dry-run
cellc publish --artifact-manifest Artifact.toml
```

The independent verifier checks the profile-specific object set and recomputes
the published hashes. Generic executable and copy bundles are `hash_bound`; this
does not claim executable semantics, reproducibility, or a security review. A
CellScript CKB bundle may opt into the 0.24 structural boundary by providing
all of `metadata`, `lowering_record`, and `source_map` in addition to source,
executable, and ABI. Partial sidecar sets fail closed. The separate
least-privilege artifact worker runs the compiler-independent checker and emits
`structurally_verified` evidence with checker version, policy schema, and
report hash. That evidence maps to accepted `verification_status = verified`,
but remains neither source equivalence nor deployment evidence. A reproducible
build is marked `evidence_required` until
appropriate build evidence exists; merely uploading output bytes does not prove
reproducibility.

### LS-IDL Lock Script interface

A deployable `ckb_executable` with `ckb.script_role = "lock"` may add a
`cellscript-registry-ls-idl-interface-v1` contract. The ABI object is the exact
LS-IDL JSON byte sequence; its SHA-256 must match the contract and the
executable's final 32 bytes. Use `cellc artifact ls-idl validate`, `bind`, and
`bundle` to construct this relationship. The normal and least-privilege
verifiers independently enforce it.

This adds a discoverable interface identity, not a semantic implementation or
security claim. The full schema, supported field encodings, compatibility
vectors, and operator boundary are in
[`CELLSCRIPT_LS_IDL_REGISTRY_PROFILE.md`](CELLSCRIPT_LS_IDL_REGISTRY_PROFILE.md).

## Accepting Reproduction Evidence

The Registry never executes an arbitrary publisher build recipe in its API
process. Independent builders execute the signed recipe in the declared
environment and emit bounded reports:

```json
{
  "schema": "cellscript-reproduction-report-v2",
  "builder_id": "builder-a",
  "trust_domain": "independent-org-a",
  "builder_public_key": "p256-spki:<base64-der>",
  "environment": "<exact signed environment>",
  "source_hash": "<CKB Blake2b-256>",
  "build_recipe_hash": "<CKB Blake2b-256>",
  "artifact_hash": "<CKB Blake2b-256>",
  "build_log_hash": "<CKB Blake2b-256>",
  "generated_at": "2026-08-02T00:00:00Z",
  "signature": {
    "algorithm": "p256-sha256",
    "signature": "<base64url-fixed-signature>"
  }
}
```

Generate each report next to the reproduced artifact and bounded build log:

```bash
# Run once inside each independent builder's own administrative domain.
cellc auth reproducer create \
  --builder-id builder-a \
  --trust-domain independent-org-a \
  --json > reports/builder-a-enrollment.json

cellc artifact reproduction-report acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 \
  --artifact target/vault-lock \
  --build-log reports/builder-a.log \
  --builder-id builder-a \
  --trust-domain independent-org-a \
  --builder-key-id cap_<sha256-prefix> \
  --builder-public-key 'p256-spki:<base64url-der>' \
  --output reports/builder-a.json
```

The create command emits a public `policy_builder` record and stores the
corresponding private key in that builder's OS keychain. For CI enrollment,
on Unix, pass `--private-key-output <new-file>` to write PKCS#8 base64 into a
new mode-0600 file, move its value into that builder's secret manager as
`CELLSCRIPT_REPRODUCER_PRIVATE_KEY_PKCS8_B64`, and do not send the file to the
Registry operator. Only the public `policy_builder` record crosses the trust
boundary.

Create the operator promotion payload locally:

```bash
cellc artifact reproduction-evidence acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 \
  --report reports/builder-a.json \
  --report reports/builder-b.json \
  --output reproduced-build-promotion.json
```

The CLI verifies every report signature and requires distinct builder IDs,
public keys, and trust domains. The API additionally requires each builder to
match `REGISTRY_REPRODUCER_POLICY_JSON` and enforces its configured minimum
trust-domain count. Both layers require exact matches for the signed environment,
source, recipe, executable, and build log. The promotion also references the
accepted `verified_build` evidence. Accepted evidence records the canonical
policy SHA-256 and the threshold used for that decision, so later policy
rotation cannot rewrite the historical trust boundary. A reproducible artifact
stays `evidence_required`, and deployment admission fails, until
`reproduced_build` evidence is accepted.

Distinct policy labels are necessary but cannot prove organizational
independence. The production operator must obtain each public key from a builder
under separate administrative control and private-key custody. Creating two
keys inside the Registry operator's own infrastructure and assigning different
`trust_domain` strings does not satisfy this model. Readiness proves that the
policy is well-formed and that its P-256 keys are importable; it does not attest
who controls those keys.

## Consuming Other Artifacts

Generic artifacts never pass through `cellc install`. Use the explicit
consumer commands:

```bash
cellc artifact fetch acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --output vault-lock.bundle.json
cellc artifact verify --bundle vault-lock.bundle.json --receipt vault-lock.bundle.json.receipt.json
cellc artifact pin acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --output Artifacts.lock --accept-hash-bound
cellc artifact copy acme/starter@1.0.0 --destination ./new-project --accept-hash-bound
cellc artifact reproduction-evidence acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --report builder-a.json --report builder-b.json --output reproduced-build-promotion.json
cellc artifact record-deployment acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --code-hash <hash> --hash-type data1 --dep-type code --tx-hash <tx_hash> --index 0 --capability-key-id <key_id>
cellc artifact cell-dep acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --output CellDep.json --accept-hash-bound --rpc-url https://mainnet.ckb.dev/rpc
cellc artifact set-availability acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --status yanked --reason "security advisory" --capability-key-id <key_id>
cellc artifact commitment acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --output RegistryCommitment.json
```

`fetch` checks the immutable object's SHA-256 identity and every CKB object
hash. `verify` repeats those checks offline from the receipt. `pin` records the
exact Registry identity and requires an explicit trust decision for
integrity-only evidence. `copy` is no-overwrite and rejects traversal,
platform-specific, duplicate, or unauthenticated paths. `cell-dep` requires an
attached RPC-verified mainnet deployment and preserves the DepGroup container
and resolved code-member identities. Before writing `CellDep.json`, it queries
mainnet again, rejects a spent deployment or resolved code member, checks the
RPC chain identity, and rebinds `hash_type` / `dep_type` to the signed profile
contract. It never turns an `undeployed` release into a CellDep.

`record-deployment` derives the artifact/data identity from the signed Registry
release, signs a payload for the network fixed by the selected Registry
environment, and sends it to the API for live-Cell verification. Production is
mainnet-only; Pudge is testnet-only. Both publisher and recovery paths
reject deployment modes that differ from `profile_contract.ckb`.

`set-availability` is the publisher control-plane path used by the Manage UI.
It signs a short-lived, nonce-protected capability payload; publishers may set
`active`, `deprecated`, or `yanked`, while administrative quarantine remains a
separate privileged action.

`commitment` verifies the Registry response against the locally fetched signed
release, then writes the canonical `cellscript-registry-commitment-v1` payload,
CKB Blake2b commitment, compact `CSREGv1 || hash` Cell data, fixed Registry
Type/Lock hashes, and a wallet-ready mainnet transaction intent. The wallet,
not the Registry or CLI, completes capacity, inputs, change, fee, witnesses,
signatures, and broadcast.

The Registry accepts an on-chain commitment only after reading a sufficiently
confirmed live mainnet Cell and matching its exact data, configured commitment
Lock, and configured Registry Type Script. Readiness separately resolves and
checks the Type and Lock code CellDeps. Scheduled maintenance uses an exact Type
Script indexer query plus the `CSREGv1` prefix to discover commitments and
reconcile their live lifecycle.

This contract indexes code/artifact evidence; it does not take ownership of
application business Cells. Business state remains governed by the
application's own Lock/Type Scripts, schemas, and replacement transactions.

## Publisher Authorisation

The preferred interactive path is `cellc publish --authorise`. The CLI creates
the delegated P-256 key, stores it as pending in the OS keychain, and opens a
15-minute exact-coordinate browser session. The browser receives only a
fragment token and the public capability request. After a supported wallet
signs the Registry-built challenge, one transaction consumes the nonce,
registers the publishing key, claims or reviews the namespace, completes the
session, and appends audit events. The polling CLI activates the key only when
the Registry returns the matching key ID, then resumes the original publish.

Completed or review-pending sessions remain readable for 24 hours. A same-tab
refresh preserves the browser token, while completion or expiry removes it.
Only Registry-confirmed cancellation or pending-session expiry removes a
pending local key; a local polling timeout preserves it for recovery.

The explicit capability-create/submit and namespace-claim commands remain the
auditable manual path for CI and external wallet handoff. CCC-detected signers
connect directly; directory-only wallets link out and require a compatible
`wallet-signature.json`. Neither path accepts mnemonic words. Production has no
network selector; the Pudge site and API are separate testnet-only origins.

## Public Reads

```text

```

The list endpoint accepts `q`, `namespace`, `kind`, `verification`,
`deployment`, `availability`, `limit`, and `offset`. Without an explicit
`verification` filter, public discovery includes only accepted verification
states and excludes `pending` / `rejected`. Pagination offsets count package
coordinates, not version rows. Static release objects and
immutable bundles are served separately from the write database so consumers
can hash-verify and cache them independently.

Example discovery request:

```bash
curl --fail 'https://api.registry.cellscript.dev/v1/artifacts?kind=deployable_contract&deployment=chain_verified'
```

The website exposes Registry, Submit, and API as peer tabs. Detail pages show
artifact kind, consumption mode, all three state axes, release hashes,
verification evidence, and mainnet deployment evidence without pretending
that every artifact is installable.

## Fail-Closed Rules

- Unknown kinds, profiles, languages, object roles, and state values fail.
- LS-IDL lookup returns only an active, public, chain-verified deployable Lock
  Script with a schema-valid, raw-byte SHA-256/suffix-bound interface; type-hash
  lookup requires `data_hash`, and ambiguous candidates fail.
- Identifiers are 1–64 lowercase letters or digits; `_` and `-` are allowed
  only between characters.
- A source dependency resolver rejects every non-CellScript profile.
- A CKB deployment requires prior verified-build evidence.
- A reproducible CKB deployment additionally requires accepted
  `reproduced_build` evidence.
- Deployment evidence must match the published executable hash and a live
  mainnet Cell.
- Quarantined releases are not returned by public detail or evidence routes.
- The database admits positive identity/state atomically before publishing its
  mutable static mirror. Suppressive states are mirrored first to fail closed;
  other mirror failures are audited and retried by verification sync, so an
  uncommitted release or deployment is never advertised as current.
- State transitions append evidence; they do not mutate hash identity.
- An unconfigured, partially configured, spent, or insufficiently confirmed
  Registry Type/Lock Script and CellDep set cannot produce a wallet transaction
  intent or current commitment.

## Validation

Registry changes are covered by the repository gates:

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh dev
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh ci
```

The `ci` gate typechecks and tests the API, builds Node API/verifier bundles,
runs the independent Rust verifier, checks the website build, and validates the
compiler and CLI surfaces that create and consume Registry records.
