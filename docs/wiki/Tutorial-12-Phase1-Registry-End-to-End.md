# Tutorial 12: Registry Artifacts End to End

**Status**: current tutorial for publishing and inspecting CellScript and
non-CellScript artifacts in the public Registry.

The Registry is not limited to dependency packages. It distinguishes source
libraries, profile libraries, CKB runtime verifiers, deployable contracts,
reproducible binaries, and copy-only templates. This tutorial uses the native
CellScript path first, then the generic artifact path.

## 1. Authorise the first publish

Start from the package or artifact directory, not from an empty browser form:

```bash
cellc publish --authorise
```

`cellc` creates the delegated P-256 key, stores it as pending in the local OS
keychain, opens a 15-minute exact-coordinate Registry session, waits for wallet
approval, and then resumes the original publish. The private key never enters
the browser. The Registry atomically registers the public key, claims or reviews
the namespace, completes the session, and records the audit trail. Use
`--no-open` to print the browser URL for a remote or terminal-only environment.

The browser token is fragment-only, survives a same-tab refresh, and is removed
on completion or expiry. Completed or review-pending sessions remain readable
to the polling CLI for 24 hours so an approval committed near the deadline can
be recovered. A local polling timeout preserves the pending key unless the
Registry confirms cancellation or pending-session expiry.

The production site has no network selector and accepts mainnet evidence only.
Pudge testing uses `https://testnet.registry.cellscript.dev/registry`, with a
different API origin, database, object store, signing identity, wallet state,
and testnet-only evidence. Start that flow explicitly with:

```bash
cellc publish --authorise --api-url https://api.testnet.registry.cellscript.dev
```

Sandbox records disappear from discovery after 72 hours and their source bytes
are purged after a 24-hour grace period; this does not erase Pudge chain history.
The explicit capability-submit and namespace-claim commands remain available
for CI, external-wallet signing, and recovery.

## 2. Publish a CellScript source library

Add the namespace to `Cell.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "math"
version = "1.0.0"
namespace = "acme"
```

Verify and publish:

```bash
cellc package verify --json
cellc publish --dry-run
cellc publish --authorise  # first publish
cellc publish              # later publishes with an active delegated key
```

Use `--artifact-kind profile_library` when the package is a named CellScript
profile library. Both kinds use compiler-backed verification and remain valid
`Cell.toml` dependencies.

## 3. Publish a deployable CKB contract

Create `Artifact.toml`:

```toml
schema = "cellscript-registry-artifact"
namespace = "acme"
name = "vault-lock"
release = "1.0.0"
kind = "deployable_contract"
language = "rust"
bundle = "vault-lock.bundle.json"
description = "Vault lock Script"
```

Create a closed profile contract first. Its ABI hash is the CKB Blake2b-256 of
the immutable ABI object:

```json
{
  "schema": "cellscript-registry-profile-contract-v1",
  "artifact_kind": "deployable_contract",
  "profile": "ckb_executable",
  "build": {
    "target": "riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf",
    "toolchain": "rustc 1.97.1",
    "profile": "release",
    "source_revision": "<immutable revision>",
    "reproducible": false
  },
  "security": { "status": "review_required" },
  "ckb": {
    "vm_version": "2",
    "script_role": "lock",
    "hash_type": "data1",
    "dep_type": "code",
    "abi_hash": "<ABI object CKB Blake2b-256>"
  }
}
```

Canonicalize it recursively by key and put that JSON string in the immutable
bundle. Each payload is base64-encoded bytes, not a path:

```json
{
  "schema": "cellscript-registry-bundle",
  "namespace": "acme",
  "name": "vault-lock",
  "release": "1.0.0",
  "profile": "ckb_executable",
  "manifest_json": "<canonical cellscript-registry-profile-contract-v1 JSON>",
  "objects": [
    { "role": "source", "content_base64": "..." },
    { "role": "executable", "content_base64": "..." },
    { "role": "abi", "content_base64": "..." }
  ]
}
```

Validate before sending anything:

```bash
cellc publish --artifact-manifest Artifact.toml --dry-run
```

The CLI checks the coordinate, release, kind/language pair, bundle profile,
required object roles, size limit, and computed hashes. Publish with:

```bash
cellc publish --artifact-manifest Artifact.toml
```

The release initially reports:

```text
verification_status = pending
deployment_status   = undeployed
availability_status = active
```

After the independent verifier binds the source, executable, ABI, and profile
contract hashes, verification becomes `hash_bound`. That is an integrity claim,
not a claim about Script semantics, security review, or deployment.

## 4. Prove a reproducible build

Skip this step for the non-reproducible example above. If the signed profile
sets `build.reproducible = true`, or the kind is `reproducible_binary`, the
release remains `evidence_required` until independent builders reproduce the
same executable.

Each builder writes a bounded report:

```json
{
  "schema": "cellscript-reproduction-report-v2",
  "builder_id": "builder-a",
  "trust_domain": "independent-org-a",
  "builder_public_key": "p256-spki:<base64-der>",
  "environment": "<exact environment from the signed profile>",
  "source_hash": "<CKB Blake2b-256>",
  "build_recipe_hash": "<CKB Blake2b-256>",
  "artifact_hash": "<CKB Blake2b-256>",
  "build_log_hash": "<CKB Blake2b-256>",
  "generated_at": "2026-08-02T00:00:00Z",
  "signature": {
    "algorithm": "p256-sha256",
    "signature": "<base64url-fixed-signature>"
  }
}
```

Generate a signed report on each independent builder:

```bash
cellc auth reproducer create \
  --builder-id builder-a \
  --trust-domain independent-org-a \
  --json > reports/builder-a-enrollment.json

cellc artifact reproduction-report acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 \
  --artifact target/vault-lock \
  --build-log reports/builder-a.log \
  --builder-id builder-a \
  --trust-domain independent-org-a \
  --builder-key-id cap_<sha256-prefix> \
  --builder-public-key 'p256-spki:<base64url-der>' \
  --output reports/builder-a.json
```

Each builder sends only the generated public `policy_builder` record to the
Registry operator. The private key stays in that builder's OS keychain. A CI
builder on Unix may pass `--private-key-output <new-file>` during enrollment,
import the mode-0600 file's PKCS#8 base64 value into its own secret manager as
`CELLSCRIPT_REPRODUCER_PRIVATE_KEY_PKCS8_B64`, and must not share that file.

Validate and combine at least two signed reports with distinct builder IDs,
public keys, and trust domains:

```bash
cellc artifact reproduction-evidence acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 \
  --report reports/builder-a.json \
  --report reports/builder-b.json \
  --output reproduced-build-promotion.json
```

The command verifies each P-256 report signature and fetches and verifies the
signed release, predecessor build evidence, source, recipe, artifact,
environment, and report identities. It does not execute the publisher's recipe.
A Registry operator reviews and submits the generated `reproduced_build`
promotion payload. The API also requires every builder to match its configured
policy, enforces a minimum number of trust domains, and records that policy's
canonical SHA-256 and threshold in the accepted evidence. Only then does
verification become `verified`; a reproducible executable cannot be recorded
as deployed before this transition.

## 5. Record a deployment on the Registry's fixed network

The deployment request is a signed
`cellscript-registry-deployment` / `record_deployment` payload sent to:

```text
POST /v1/artifacts/acme/vault-lock/releases/1.0.0/deployments
```

It includes the published `artifact_hash`, equal `data_hash`, `code_hash`,
`hash_type`, `dep_type`, and the environment's OutPoint. The API requires the same
namespace capability used for publishing and prior verified-build evidence.

The API first verifies the configured RPC chain identity. It calls
`get_live_cell` to prove that the OutPoint remains live and reads
`get_transaction.tx_status` to prove the creation transaction is committed and
obtain the block hash used for confirmation counting. It rejects a dead or
missing Cell, an uncommitted creation transaction, insufficient confirmation
depth, a data-hash mismatch, a Type Script hash mismatch, a network mismatch, or an
OutPoint that is not bound to the published executable. A successful request
appends deployment evidence and changes only `deployment_status` to
`chain_verified`.

For a DepGroup OutPoint, the API decodes the live Cell data as the canonical
Molecule `OutPointVec` and finds the matching live code member. It does not hash
the DepGroup container as though it were the executable.

## 6. Publish and resolve an LS-IDL Lock Script interface

For a Lock Script that follows LS-IDL 0.1, start with the original `idl.json`
bytes. Do not pretty-print or reserialise them after computing the commitment:

```bash
cellc artifact ls-idl validate --idl idl.json
cellc artifact ls-idl bind \
  --idl idl.json \
  --executable target/release/vault-lock \
  --output target/release/vault-lock.ls-idl
cellc artifact ls-idl bundle \
  --idl idl.json \
  --executable target/release/vault-lock.ls-idl \
  --source src/lib.rs \
  --namespace acme \
  --name vault-lock \
  --release 1.0.0 \
  --language rust \
  --hash-type data1 \
  --dep-type code \
  --toolchain rust-1.97.1 \
  --source-revision <40-hex-git-commit> \
  --output artifact.bundle.json \
  --artifact-manifest-output Artifact.toml
cellc publish --artifact-manifest Artifact.toml --dry-run --json
```

After publishing and recording chain-verified deployment evidence, resolve the
same bytes through either the CLI or canonical API:

```bash
cellc artifact ls-idl fetch \
  --code-hash 0x<64-hex> \
  --hash-type data1 \
  --network mainnet \
  --output idl.json

curl --fail \
  'https://api.registry.cellscript.dev/v1/ckb/scripts/0x<64-hex>/interfaces/ls-idl?network=mainnet&hash_type=data1' \
  --output idl.json
```

The compatibility route `/idl/:code_hash` returns the same original bytes for
immutable hash types. Type-hash deployments require `?data_hash=0x...` even on
that route so an upgrade cannot resolve by code hash alone.
The Registry proves the document schema, raw-byte digest, executable suffix,
and deployment identity. It does not prove that the Lock Script correctly
implements the interface, and it is not a security audit. See the
[LS-IDL Registry profile](../CELLSCRIPT_LS_IDL_REGISTRY_PROFILE.md) for the
closed schema and trust boundary.

## 7. Inspect and consume the artifact

Open the artifact detail page or query the API:

```bash
curl --fail 'https://api.registry.cellscript.dev/v1/artifacts/acme/vault-lock'
curl --fail 'https://api.registry.cellscript.dev/v1/artifacts/acme/vault-lock/releases/1.0.0/evidence'
```

Check these independently:

- artifact kind, profile, language, and consumption mode;
- source, executable, ABI, or recipe hashes;
- verification, deployment, and availability states;
- evidence producer and evidence hash;
- mainnet OutPoint, code hash, data hash, hash type, and dep type.

Do not use `cellc install` for this executable. `cellc install` accepts only
`cellscript_source` artifacts whose consumption mode is `dependency`.

Consume it explicitly:

```bash
cellc artifact fetch acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --output vault-lock.bundle.json
cellc artifact verify --bundle vault-lock.bundle.json --receipt vault-lock.bundle.json.receipt.json
cellc artifact pin acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --output Artifacts.lock --accept-hash-bound
cellc artifact reproduction-evidence acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --report builder-a.json --report builder-b.json --output reproduced-build-promotion.json
cellc artifact record-deployment acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --network mainnet --code-hash <hash> --hash-type data1 --dep-type code --tx-hash <tx_hash> --index 0 --capability-key-id <key_id>
cellc artifact cell-dep acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --output CellDep.json --accept-hash-bound --rpc-url https://mainnet.ckb.dev/rpc
cellc artifact set-availability acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --status yanked --reason "security advisory" --capability-key-id <key_id>
cellc artifact commitment acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 --output RegistryCommitment.json
```

`cell-dep` fails until mainnet deployment evidence has been verified, then
rechecks that the deployment (and resolved DepGroup code member) is still live
at consumption time. Deployment mode must equal the immutable profile
contract. The commitment file contains canonical `CSREGv1` Cell data;
current commitment still requires the API to read a sufficiently confirmed
live mainnet Cell and match its configured Type/Lock identities and both live
code CellDeps. When those Scripts and CellDeps are configured, the file
also contains a mainnet-only transaction intent. A compatible wallet completes
capacity, inputs, change, fee, witnesses, signatures, and broadcast.

Scheduled maintenance discovers exact Registry Type Script matches through the
CKB indexer. A sufficiently confirmed live matching commitment promotes the
current release to `on_chain_committed`; spending that Cell returns it to `deployed`; and spending
or replacing the deployment Cell returns it to `verified_build`. Accepted
evidence remains available for audit.

The transaction-intent and scanner code is implemented, but production does
not claim a chain commitment until operators deploy and configure the canonical
mainnet Registry Type Script, commitment custody Lock, and both code CellDeps.

For the isolated Pudge flow, use:

```bash
cellc publish --api-url https://api.testnet.registry.cellscript.dev
cellc artifact record-deployment acme/vault-lock@1.0.0 \
  --network testnet \
  --api-url https://api.testnet.registry.cellscript.dev \
  --code-hash <hash> --hash-type data1 --dep-type code \
  --tx-hash <testnet_tx_hash> --index 0 --capability-key-id <key_id>
```

`cell-dep` reads the accepted evidence network and defaults to the matching
official RPC; an explicit `--rpc-url` still has to report the same chain.

## 8. Other artifact kinds

- `runtime_verifier`: `ckb_executable` bundle with source, executable, and ABI;
  consumption mode is `tcb`.
- A generic `ckb_executable` with only `source`, `executable`, and `abi`
  remains `hash_bound`. A CellScript release may opt into independent
  structural admission by adding the complete `metadata`, `lowering_record`,
  and `source_map` role set. Supplying only part of that set fails closed. The
  least-privilege artifact worker records checker version, policy, and report
  hash as `structurally_verified` evidence; it does not load the compiler and
  does not claim source equivalence or deployment.
- A `ckb_executable` that is built reproducibly may additionally include
  `build_recipe`, set `build.reproducible = true`, and bind the recipe,
  environment, command, and expected executable hash in `reproduction`.
- `reproducible_binary`: `reproducible_build` bundle with source, executable,
  and `build_recipe`; the Registry reports `evidence_required` until build
  evidence is sufficient.
- `template`: `copy_material` bundle containing a
  `cellscript-template-file-map-v1` source object; use `cellc artifact copy`.
  It rejects traversal, duplicates, hash drift, and overwrites.

An artifact declaring `security.status = "audited"` must also carry an
immutable `audit_report` bundle object whose CKB Blake2b-256 hash exactly
matches `security.audit_report_hash`. This authenticates the referenced report;
it does not make the Registry the auditor.

## 9. Naming rules

Namespace and artifact names are 1–64 characters. Use lowercase letters and
digits; `_` and `-` may appear only between characters. A one-character name is
valid. The UI and API enforce the same rule.

## 10. Registry scope and repository validation

The Registry names code, build recipes, TCB inputs, deployment facts, and
compact commitments. It does not operate application business Cells. Those
Cells remain governed by their own Lock/Type Scripts, schemas, and replacement
transactions; publishing a Script is not equivalent to indexing every state
Cell that uses it.

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh dev
```

[`docs/CELLSCRIPT_REGISTRY_PHASE1.md`](../CELLSCRIPT_REGISTRY_PHASE1.md).
