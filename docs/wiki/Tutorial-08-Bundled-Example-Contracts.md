# Tutorial 08: Bundled Example Contracts

The repository includes ten top-level example files. Seven are in the bundled
CKB production matrix; three are non-production language or business-flow
examples. Treat them as guided reading, not just files to compile. Each one
teaches a different part of the language: linear resources, shared state,
receipts, locks, proposal flows, time checks, and evidence boundaries.

This chapter helps you choose what to read first and what to learn from each
example.

## The Examples

| Example | What it teaches |
|---|---|
| `examples/token.cell` | Minting, transfer, burn, and guarded token merge. |
| `examples/nft.cell` | Collection-bound assets, ownership transitions, typed Token settlement, and owner locks. |
| `examples/timelock.cell` | HeaderDep timepoints, Token-backed release checks, release requests, and approval flow. |
| `examples/multisig.cell` | Non-cryptographic threshold approvals, proposal records, and lock-boundary predicates. |
| `examples/vesting.cell` | Repeatable partial claims, terminal full claims, revocation, and admin-boundary comments. |
| `examples/amm_pool.cell` | TypeHash-bound pool state, bounded swap logic, liquidity receipts, LP ownership checks, and settlement effects. |
| `examples/launch.cell` | Mint-authority bootstrap and launch/pool composition patterns. |
| `examples/registry.cell` | Registry/package language surface and compiler tooling; non-production. |
| `examples/atomic_swap.cell` | Atomic swap flow-edge validation and settlement lifecycle; non-production. |
| `examples/multi_phase_dao.cell` | Multi-stage DAO proposal flow and state-transition membership; non-production. |

The top-level `examples/*.cell` files are the clean reading surface and remain
the CKB acceptance runner's business-source mirror. The package directories under
`examples/<name>/` are the package workflow version of the same examples. Use
them when you want to exercise `Cell.toml`, path dependencies, source hashing,
and cross-package type/schema imports.

The package examples deliberately show the current multi-file boundary:

- `examples/amm_pool` imports `Token` from `examples/token`;
- `examples/vesting` imports `Token` from `examples/token`;
- `examples/atomic_swap`, `examples/multi_phase_dao`, `examples/nft`, and
  `examples/timelock` import `Token` from `examples/token`;
- `examples/launch` imports `Token` and `MintAuthority` from `examples/token`,
  plus `Pool` and `LPReceipt` from `examples/amm_pool`.

Those imports reuse Cell schemas across packages. They do not link CKB scripts
into one deployed program; each package entry still compiles to its own artifact.
There are no checked-in `examples/business` or `examples/acceptance` mirrors;
acceptance-only profile/effect/scheduler metadata belongs in runner
configuration or generated files under `target/`.

Despite its legacy filename, `multisig.cell` is not a signature verifier or a
standalone custody Lock Script. Its `Approval` values and `reported_time`
arguments are witness data. A surrounding Lock Script must authenticate the
approver, and any production time policy must bind a HeaderDep-derived value.
CellScript 0.22 has no implicit signer identity, sighash selection, or witness
layout. Packages that need cryptographic custody may call the explicit BIP340
CellDep verifier ABI, but the bundled threshold-approval example deliberately
does not do so.

## Fiber Interoperability Examples

CellScript 0.22 also includes seven bounded interoperability examples under
`examples/fiber/`. They are not additional members of the bundled CKB
production matrix:

| Example | Interoperability boundary |
|---|---|
| `ordinary_fungible.cell` | Owner-authorized fungible asset; start here. |
| `fixed_supply.cell` | One initial issuance followed by conserved supply. |
| `governed_supply_cap.cell` | Policy-Cell-governed supply cap. |
| `reserve_compliance.cell` | Issuance gated by reserve/compliance state. |
| `wrapped_bridge.cell` | External bridge accounting remains outside Fiber payments. |
| `multi_asset.cell` | Explicit `--asset` selection for multiple eligible types. |
| `type_id_upgradeable.cell` | Type ID deployment with upgrade re-audit obligations. |

The `cellscript-fiber` adapter derives the dedicated artifact and native Fiber
configuration; it does not change the `.cell` source into a Fiber-specific
language. Follow the
[bounded Fiber interoperability guide](https://github.com/CellScript-Labs/CellScript/blob/nightly-0.24/examples/fiber/README.md)
for the check, deployment, enable, materialization, and doctor workflow.

`examples/registry.cell`, `examples/atomic_swap.cell`,
`examples/multi_phase_dao.cell`, and every checked-in `examples/language/*.cell`
file are intentionally outside the bundled production matrix. They are language
and non-production business-flow examples for compiler/tooling surfaces such as
local stack-backed `Vec<T>`, stdlib patterns, CKB source/witness, TYPE_ID,
Spawn/IPC, capacity/time, dynamic BLAKE2b, flow-edge validation, and
state-transition lifecycle checks. They are covered by compiler/tooling tests
rather than CKB production action acceptance.

[`token_amm_bootstrap.md`](https://github.com/CellScript-Labs/CellScript/blob/main/docs/examples/token_amm_bootstrap.md).

[Cookbook Recipes](https://github.com/CellScript-Labs/CellScript/wiki/Cookbook-Recipes).

## A Good Reading Order

If you are learning the language, read them in this order:

1. `token.cell`: start here. It is the smallest example with a clear resource
   flow.
2. `nft.cell`: learn unique assets and ownership-style locks.
3. `timelock.cell`: learn time guards and release evidence.
4. `multisig.cell`: learn proposal records and threshold logic.
5. `vesting.cell`: learn receipt-style claim flows.
6. `amm_pool.cell`: learn shared pool state after you understand resources.
7. `launch.cell`: read this last because it composes multiple patterns.
8. `atomic_swap.cell`: inspect after Tutorial 11 if you want flow-edge evidence.
9. `multi_phase_dao.cell`: inspect after registry and flow-state material.

Do not try to learn everything from the densest example first. The examples are
more useful when each one adds one new idea.

## Compile All Examples

From the repository root:

```bash
for f in examples/*.cell; do
  echo "==> $f"
  cellc "$f" --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb -o "/tmp/$(basename "$f" .cell).elf"
done
```

This is a compile pass, not a full CKB production claim. It is useful while
learning because it shows that the examples fit the compiler and CKB profile.
Use `--primitive-strict 0.16` for the pre-production ProofPlan gate. The token,
AMM, and launch examples now compile their bundled business actions as original
scoped entries under that strict gate; keep the matching chain evidence before
calling the artifacts production-ready.

To exercise the package form and dependency graph from the examples workspace:

```bash
cd examples
cellc build --package token --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb --json
cellc build --package amm_pool --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb --json
cellc build --package launch --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb --json
```

Do not treat `cellc build --workspace` as the canonical compile-all command for
this checked-in examples tree. Some folders under `examples/` are compiler and
tooling fixtures rather than packages with a `src/main.cell` entry.

Package metadata includes source-unit hashes for the entry package and local
path dependencies, so reviewers can see which `.cell` files participated in the
compile.

## Token Walkthrough

Start with the token example. It is small enough to keep in your head.

The token example declares two resources:

```cellscript
resource Token has store, create, consume, replace, burn, relock {
    amount: u64
    symbol: [u8; 8]
}

resource MintAuthority has store, create, replace {
    token_symbol: [u8; 8]
    max_supply: u64
    minted: u64
}
```

`Token` is the asset. `MintAuthority` is the state that limits how much can be
minted. The checked-in `examples/token.cell` declares `MintAuthority` with
`store, create, replace`, because another action has to create the first
authority Cell before `mint_with_authority` can consume it.

`mint_with_authority` updates authority state and validates a proposed new token output:

```cellscript
action mint_with_authority(auth_before: MintAuthority, to: Address, amount: u64) -> (auth_after: MintAuthority, token: Token) {
    transition auth_before -> auth_after

    verification
        require auth_before.minted + amount <= auth_before.max_supply, "exceeds max supply"
        require auth_after.token_symbol == auth_before.token_symbol
        require auth_after.max_supply == auth_before.max_supply
        require auth_after.minted == auth_before.minted + amount

        create token = Token {
            amount,
            symbol: auth_before.token_symbol
        } with_lock(to)
}
```

Read `auth_before` as the existing authority Cell and `auth_after` as the
proposed output. The action signature names the input/output topology; the
`require` guards are the field-level proof.

This is the key bootstrap boundary: `mint_with_authority` is not a genesis action. A builder
must first create a real `MintAuthority` Cell, normally with
`examples/launch.cell::bootstrap_token` or `examples/launch.cell::launch_token`,
then pass that Cell as the runtime-bound `auth_before` input to
`examples/token.cell::mint_with_authority`.

`transfer_token` consumes an input token and validates a proposed output
under a new lock:

```cellscript
action transfer_token(token: Token, to: Address) -> next_token: Token {
    verification
        consume token

        create next_token = Token {
            amount: token.amount,
            symbol: token.symbol
        } with_lock(to)
}
```

`burn` consumes the token and destroys it:

```cellscript
action burn(token: Token) {
    verification
        require token.amount > 0, "cannot burn zero"
        destroy token
}
```

These three actions show the basic resource effect flow: propose an output,
update state, destroy state.

## Locks In The Examples

The bundled locks use `protected` to show the input Cell guarded by the current
lock invocation and `witness` to show decoded transaction witness data. Those
markers do not make an `Address` a signer proof.

When you see a lock like this:

```cellscript
lock owner_only(protected asset: NFT, witness claimed_owner: Address) -> bool {
    verification
        require asset.owner == claimed_owner
}
```

read it carefully:

- `asset` is the protected input Cell view;
- `claimed_owner` is decoded witness data;
- `require` fails the script if the comparison is false;
- the comparison does not prove that `claimed_owner` signed the transaction.

Real signature authorization still needs explicit sighash verification and its
own positive and negative CKB transaction matrix. `lock_args` can expose where
script-args data comes from, but it does not turn an `Address` into a signer.

## CKB Production Expectations

The CKB profile is strict, and the bundled suite has a defined production
boundary:

- bundled examples compile under the CKB profile;
- strict v0.16 ProofPlan gate checks pass for the original scoped token, AMM, and
  launch business actions;
- bundled business actions have scoped CKB production harnesses;
- bundled locks have builder-backed valid-spend and invalid-spend matrices;
- valid CKB transactions are builder-generated and dry-run;
- malformed transactions are rejected for non-policy/non-capacity reasons;
- transaction size, cycles, and occupied-capacity evidence are retained;
- bundled examples are deployed in the CKB production acceptance report;
- the final production hardening gate must pass.

This does not mean arbitrary new contracts are automatically production-ready.
Use the examples as patterns, then run your own constraints review, entry ABI
review, builder evidence, security review, and chain acceptance evidence.

## Production Checklist

Before treating an example-derived contract as deployable, run the compiler-side
checks:

```bash
cellc fmt --check
cellc check --target-profile ckb --production
cellc build --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb --production
cellc verify-artifact build/main.elf --verify-sources --expect-target-profile ckb --production
cellc examples/nft.cell --entry-action transfer --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb --primitive-strict 0.16 --production
```

`--entry-action` selects a single action entry point for targeted inspection.

For release-facing CKB evidence, run the CellScript acceptance gate:

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh release
```

This wrapper runs compiler/backend evidence and the syntax-combination CI
preflight before the builder-backed CKB acceptance script, so bundled examples
cannot become release evidence if a
new syntax/lowering combination is failing.

Do not use compile-only or bounded diagnostic runs as production release
evidence. They are helpful during development, but they do not replace the chain
acceptance boundary.
