# CellScript Gate Redundancy Audit

Status: 2026-08-09

This report audits redundant or overly repetitive work in the CellScript gate
stack. It covers the unified gate entry point, lower-level audit runners,
GitHub workflows, website build checks, and VS Code extension release checks.

## Summary

The audit did not find a safe reason to remove the core evidence gates:

- `cellscript_strict_backend_audit.sh`
- `cellscript_syntax_combo_audit.sh`
- `ckb_cellscript_acceptance.sh`

Those checks overlap in the broad sense that they all exercise compiler output,
but they prove different boundaries. The safe optimisations are in repeated
tooling invocations around the gates, not in the compiler, syntax, or CKB
acceptance coverage itself.

## Fixed Redundancy

| Area | Previous behaviour | Updated behaviour | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Release auxiliary checks | `release` and `release-quick` run `run_ci_gate`, then repeated `cellscript-tools check-skill-pack`, `check_script_syntax`, and `check_trailing_whitespace` inside `run_release_auxiliary_checks`. | Release modes now inherit those checks from the embedded CI gate and keep release auxiliary checks focused on release-only docs, CKB, NovaSeal, and VS Code evidence. | Low. The checks still run before release-only checks. |
| Website build in the unified gate | `run_website_build_check` ran `npm --prefix website run prepare:registry`, checked generated data, then ran `npm --prefix website run build`; the `build` script ran `prepare:registry` again. An intermediate optimisation called Astro directly but accidentally bypassed website regression suites. | The gate prepares and checks registry data once, then runs `npm --prefix website run build:ci`. That target runs the full Registry, playground, visual, homepage, preference, docs, dist, and deploy regression sequence before Astro output is accepted. | Low. Registry generation remains single-pass and the previously bypassed regression evidence is restored. |
| Website build workflow | `.github/workflows/website-build.yml` ran automatically on PRs and pushes, duplicating the website build already covered by the unified CI gate. It also ran `npm --prefix website run build`, which generated registry data again. | The workflow is manual-only via `workflow_dispatch`, keeping the `website/dist` artifact path available on demand. It generates and checks registry data once, then runs the same `build:ci` regression contract as the unified gate. | Low. Automatic merge-readiness coverage remains in the unified CI gate, and manual artifacts cannot bypass the website regressions. |
| VS Code release path | Release auxiliary checks ran `npm run validate`, which built the extension, then `npm run publish:dry-run`, which explicitly built again and then let `vsce package` run `vscode:prepublish`, building again. | The gate directly runs `vsce package --no-dependencies`, letting `vsce` perform the one required prepublish build, then runs `node scripts/validate.mjs` directly against the built output. | Low. The VSIX dry-run and manifest validation still run. |

The release tooling validator enforces the `build:ci` call and its ordered
regression sequence so the optimisation cannot drift into a direct-Astro
bypass.

## Intentional Overlap Kept

### Strict Backend Audit After `cargo test`

`ci` and `backend` run broad Rust tests before invoking the strict backend
audit. The strict backend audit then re-runs selected filtered tests to produce
feature-level evidence in `target/cellscript-strict-backend-audit/`.

This is execution overlap, but not redundant evidence. Removing the filtered
audit runs would require a new report model that can derive the same feature
coverage from the broad `cargo test` run.

### Syntax-Combination Audit And CKB Acceptance

The syntax-combination audit covers parser, formatter, type checking, lowering,
metadata, codegen, and negative syntax oracles. CKB acceptance covers concrete
builder-backed transaction behaviour, dry-run evidence, capacity, cycles, and
production hardening. A direct CKB acceptance run does not replace the syntax
preflight.

### `git diff --check` And Full Trailing-Whitespace Checks

`git diff --check` catches whitespace errors in the current diff. The explicit
trailing-whitespace check scans a curated tracked-file set. They are related,
but not equivalent.

### `cargo package --list` And `cargo package`

`cargo package --list` supports the package contents audit. `cargo package`
then validates actual package construction. They should remain separate.

## Cross-Workflow Result

The PR/push path has one automatic website build source: the unified CI gate.
The standalone website workflow remains available for manual artifact
generation only. Both paths use the same Node 22 `build:ci` contract, while
only the unified gate determines automatic merge readiness.

## Validation

The updated paths were checked with:

```bash
bash -n scripts/cellscript_gate.sh
cargo run --quiet --locked -p cellscript-tools --bin cellscript-tools -- \
  --root . validate-tooling-release
git diff --check
npm --prefix website run prepare:registry
npm --prefix website run build:ci
(cd editors/vscode-cellscript && npm exec -- vsce package --no-dependencies --out /tmp/cellscript-vscode-dry-run.vsix)
node editors/vscode-cellscript/scripts/validate.mjs
```

Node 22 is the supported runtime for both the website and Registry API. CI and
release workflows install it explicitly, and the unified `ci` gate rejects a
different Node major before running Node-backed checks.
