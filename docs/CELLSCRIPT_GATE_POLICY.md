# CellScript Gate Policy

CellScript uses one top-level gate entry point:

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh <dev|ci|backend|release|release-quick>
```

The lower-level audit scripts remain available for focused debugging, but they
are implementation details of the gate policy. Prefer the unified gate when
deciding whether a change is ready.

## Gate Modes

| Mode | When to run | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `dev` | Local development before pushing | Rust formatting, canonical CellScript example formatting, all workspace-package Rust checks (including `cellscript-tools`) plus the independent Registry verifier crate; reproducible Registry Type Script build and CKB-VM tests; strict backend quick audit, syntax-combination quick audit, parity-gated skill-pack freshness, README-linked CellScript doc Status freshness, local markdown link check, installer release-origin dry run, whitespace diff check |
| `ci` | Pull requests, pushes, and routine merge readiness | Canonical CellScript example formatting; tests and clippy for the compiler, Fiber adapter, CKB adapter, WASM crate, CKB SDK builder example, `cellscript-tools`, and the Registry verifier; reproducible Registry Type Script identity plus CKB-VM tests and clippy; Registry API typecheck/tests, Node API/verifier bundles, and dry-run Worker build; strict backend CI audit; package verification; parity-gated skill-pack/doc freshness; local-link, script syntax, and installer release-origin checks |
| `backend` | Changes touching IR, codegen, assembler, ABI, ELF, or RISC-V behavior | Full Rust tests, clippy, and strict backend full audit, including stateful CKB scenarios |
| `release` | Nightly/stable release candidates and any production CKB claim | Clean tagged source plus `ci`, a fresh size-gated website WASM rebuild, tooling/docs and VS Code checks, pinned-CKB acceptance harnesses, public builder-contract generation, and mandatory stateful scenario/action coverage |
| `release-quick` | Wrapper compatibility and local compile-only preflight | `ci` plus compile-only production acceptance; not external live/devnet evidence |

`release-quick` is kept for `scripts/cellscript_ckb_release_gate.sh quick`.
Use `release` for any production or external live/devnet claim.

`dev` and `ci` run `cellc fmt --check` against
`examples/language/canonical_style.cell`. The formatter's comma-terminated
field form is the canonical checked-in surface; the parser may continue to
accept comma-free fields as compatibility input. The same modes reject raw
`u64` maximum and `MAX - delta` magic literals in the checked NFT, timelock,
atomic-swap, and multi-phase-DAO example pairs; boundary arithmetic must use
their local `U64_MAX` constants.

Both modes also execute the one-line installer in dry-run mode and require its
direct download URL to resolve under `CellScript-Labs/CellScript`. This keeps
the public release assets and the installer's latest-version lookup on the same
canonical repository identity without modifying the developer's machine.

Both release modes fail before doing expensive work unless the CellScript tree
is completely clean, including untracked files. CI additionally requires the
exact `v<workspace-version>` tag at `HEAD`; a manual release dispatch must name
the same version as the root `[package].version`. The GitHub Release workflow
runs the full `release` gate first, and binary builds plus publication depend on
that job succeeding.

The 0.23 tooling migration is complete. `cellscript-tools` owns the backend,
syntax-combination, skill-pack, tooling-release, CKB production-evidence,
NovaSeal, and Evolving-DOB gate logic. Website data generation is implemented
by Node scripts in `website/scripts/`. Dev, CI, backend, and release gates have
no Python runtime dependency and reject tracked Python source files.

The 0.23 line also has one edition contract: every package declares
`edition = "2026"`, and all emitted evidence binds the resolved compatibility
profile. The edition owns source semantics only; target, primitive assurance,
metadata schemas, and entry/witness ABIs remain independent profile axes.
Missing/non-2026 editions and superseded lock, deployment, receipt, builder, or
raw-witness placement identities are rejected rather than migrated. See
[`CELLSCRIPT_EDITION_POLICY.md`](CELLSCRIPT_EDITION_POLICY.md). Edition-owned
source changes require complete frontend closure. Independently versioned ABI
changes require the `backend` gate in addition to ordinary `dev` and `ci`
coverage.

The `ci` gate also typechecks/tests `services/registry-api`, builds both Node
entrypoints, performs its Wrangler dry-run build, and runs tests and clippy for
the independent real-compiler Registry verifier crate. `dev` at least checks
that verifier crate. This pins the single `/v1/artifacts` contract, orthogonal
verification/deployment/availability states, generic artifact bundles,
mainnet deployment evidence, additive migrations, worker boundary, and
database/static-object shape to the CLI-generated Registry entry. It is local
service coverage, not evidence
that Cloudflare, R2, Hyperdrive, Neon, DNS, or a production deployment works.
The CLI coverage includes both first-publish admission paths: the explicit
`cellc auth capability submit`, `cellc auth namespace claim`, then
`cellc publish` sequence, and the short-lived `cellc publish --authorise`
browser session in which the private publishing key remains in the local OS
keychain as pending while the CLI polls with a one-time secret, becomes active
only after the server returns the matching key ID, and is removed only after
the server confirms terminal cancellation or pending-session expiry. A local
polling deadline performs a final authoritative read and preserves the pending
key if the result is still pending or unreachable. Completed sessions remain
poll-readable for a bounded 24-hour recovery window. The browser token survives
a same-tab refresh but is cleared after completion or expiry; the website build
runs the fragment-store-refresh-clear lifecycle regression. Browser-session
completion is one atomic admission boundary across
nonce consumption, publishing-key registration, namespace claim/review,
session state, and audit events. API tests cover expiry, wrong browser/poll/
challenge tokens, challenge replay, concurrent completion, conflicting
namespace ownership, review-pending admission, post-expiry terminal reads, and
injected mid-transaction failure. Publisher maintenance additionally uses the capability-signed
`cellc artifact set-availability` path, and `cellc artifact cell-dep` performs a
fresh mainnet liveness check before producing a transaction-builder descriptor.
Independent reproducibility builders use `cellc auth reproducer create`; CLI
coverage verifies that its public enrollment contains an importable P-256 SPKI,
that private PKCS#8 material never appears in JSON output, and that explicit CI
secret files are mode 0600 on Unix and no-overwrite.
Capability registration does not silently claim a namespace;
the claim response must be `active` before the write API accepts a version.
Registry API tests pin both accepted publisher roots: JoyID signatures under
`principal_type = joyid_ckb` and recoverable CKB message signatures under
`principal_type = ckb_secp256k1`. CLI fixtures use the generic
`--wallet-signature` surface; the former `--joyid-signature` spelling remains a
visible compatibility alias and does not define a second request shape.
Explicit `--allow-unverified` and `--allow-quarantined` install choices are
persisted per dependency so the lock refresh and later builds exercise the
same auditable resolver policy.

Both `dev` and `ci` also build the independent
`contracts/registry-type-script` crate for
`riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf`, strip it with the pinned toolchain, verify the
tracked canonical ELF's SHA-256 and CKB data hash, and execute that ELF's
positive and negative lifecycle matrix in CKB-VM through `ckb-testtool`.
Linux x86_64 additionally requires the fresh build to match the tracked ELF
byte-for-byte. Other build hosts record their host artifact hash and make no
cross-host reproduction claim; the pinned container builder provides that
canonical check there.
Passing this local boundary proves the deployed bytes' behavior and identity;
it does not prove that the code Cell or custody Lock CellDep is live on
mainnet. Production readiness still performs live RPC and confirmation checks.

The full gate reads `scripts/ckb_acceptance_pin.json` and rejects a CKB checkout
whose revision or worktree differs from the pin. Its report binds the CKB
version string, executable SHA-256, source-template hashes, effective devnet
configuration hashes, and genesis hash. Production on-chain acceptance always
rebuilds CKB from that source in a fresh dedicated Cargo target directory and
archives the executable with the report; supplied or cached binaries cannot
satisfy the production gate. It then runs the exact stateful 43-action matrix
and validates every step's commit, spent-input liveness, live outputs, cycles,
serialized size, and occupied capacity. `--stateful-scenarios` remains only as
an explicit option for bounded runs.

The backend gate normally resolves that checkout as the sibling `../ckb`
directory. When that path is occupied by another development worktree, set
`CELLSCRIPT_CKB_REPO` to a separate clean checkout at the exact pinned revision;
the stateful wrapper forwards it as the acceptance harness's `--ckb-repo`.
This avoids modifying or stashing an unrelated CKB worktree during release
validation.

For `release` and `release-quick`, pass the same checkout with `--ckb-repo`.
The release gate stages the independent `ckb-tx-measure` workspace under
`target/` with its tracked manifest, lockfile, and source so its relative CKB
dependencies resolve against that explicit checkout too. The default remains
the sibling `../ckb`; the tracked lockfile remains bound to the release pin.

The transaction matrix is produced by the native Rust acceptance harness and
is intentionally labelled as recipe-replayer evidence, not generated-builder
output. Separately, the gate runs the public `cellc action build` and
`cellc gen-builder` surfaces for every production action and hashes their
generated contracts. Resource Type Scripts in these local transactions remain
`always_success` fixtures; the report records that this proves verifier
behaviour and transaction shape, not a production passive-resource-identity
deployment.

### Fiber integration evidence

The no-profile Fiber path has a separate, non-gating acceptance entry point:

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_fiber_acceptance.sh --static
```

Static mode runs the dedicated CKB-VM transaction matrix, adapter tests, and
adapter clippy. It proves only compiler/artifact compatibility; it does not
prove that a Fiber node loaded configuration, advertised an asset, opened a
channel, routed a payment, or settled on chain.

Full mode consumes externally produced `compatibility.json` and
`acceptance.json` reports from a pinned Fiber checkout. It validates exact
revision/fingerprint bindings and requires every declared positive and negative
matrix row. Every completed row and certified topology report must cite a
non-empty regular file beneath an explicit evidence root together with its CKB
Blake2b-256 digest. Absolute paths, parent traversal, symlinks, missing files,
and digest mismatches fail closed. These bindings prove evidence-bundle
integrity, not who produced it. Fiber's native `node_info` exposes a seven-hex
build abbreviation, so full mode also checks the selected checkout's complete
40-hex HEAD. The script does not start, restart, configure, sign for, or stop
operator-owned CKB/Fiber nodes. Until the live matrix is stable and explicitly
promoted, neither `dev`, `ci`, `backend`, nor `release` runs this external
integration boundary.

The ordinary `dev`, `ci`, and `backend` gates do compile the adapter; `ci` and
`backend` also run its unit tests and clippy. This is workspace-code coverage,
not external Fiber lifecycle evidence.

On 2026-07-20, bounded non-gating local-devnet runs passed Fiber's official
`udt-router-pay` and
`watchtower/force-close-with-pending-tlcs-and-udt` collections with the exact
CellScript artifact and generated native configuration. Those observations are
recorded in the roadmap, but do not satisfy full mode because the CKB executable
and Fiber source/build were observed only in a bounded local fixture, no signed
announcement report was captured, and the complete declared matrix was not
produced.

### Nightly 0.22 compiler evidence

The `nightly-0.22` line adds compile-time callable-effect contracts and
transaction-local terminal-flow evidence. These remain inside the existing gate
modes; they do not create a new gate command:

- `dev` and `ci` reject underdeclared `fn` effects, including transitive calls
  through source-authenticated package imports.
- invariant `reads` and aggregate operands share the closed `SourceView` /
  typed-target model; parser, type checking, IR, ProofPlan, formatter, and
  xUDT helper selection no longer reparse source-view strings independently;
- canonical 0.22 flows use an enum-backed state field, exactly one `initial`
  state, at least one `terminal` state, and no outgoing terminal edge;
- terminal discharge is currently only `terminal-by-output-state`, backed by
  generated state-transition checks and emitted as `checked-runtime` ProofPlan
  evidence;
- every ProofPlan record carries exactly one evidence tier:
  `checked-static`, `checked-runtime`, `runtime-helper-required`,
  `builder-evidence-required`, `metadata-only`, or
  `chain-evidence-required`;
- `--production` rejects `metadata-only` records whose invariant, terminal, or
  assert/check/enforce/require/validate/verify naming claims executable
  enforcement;
- legacy flows without initial/terminal declarations and numeric state fields
  remain accepted for migration, but metadata carries explicit audit warnings;
- none of this metadata proves that every live on-chain Cell eventually reaches
  a terminal state. `release` still requires exact-artifact and chain evidence
  before a production claim.

Metadata schema `54` carries declared/inferred/effective function effects, the
initial, terminal, discharge, state-model, and audit-warning fields for flows,
the canonical evidence tier on ProofPlan, flow, and function metadata, and
typed transaction-view handle records under
`runtime.transaction_view_handles`, `runtime.borrow_regions`,
`runtime.capability_proofs`, plus
`types[].validity_predicates`. Handle records must remain
`ownership = read-only-view`, carry `lifecycle_authority = false`, and report
checked-static typing plus checked-runtime read evidence.
Consumers must reject unsupported schema versions instead of silently dropping
these fields.

Schema 55 additionally carries
`runtime.fungible_type_group_entry`. That record is present only for the
dedicated, payload-free `fungible-type-group-v1` compilation path and binds the
selected type, 16-byte field, runtime helper, witness policy, the legacy
32-byte input-Lock authority and tagged 33-byte input-Type-Script authority,
and the unauthorised non-empty/conservation contract.
Ordinary action compilation must not emit it.

Concrete payload enum evidence is top-level under `enum_layouts`. Every record
pins the one-byte tag, packed variant field offsets, encoded width, storage
class, ownership, and ABI. Non-linear values use fixed bytes; pure-helper
returns up to 16 bytes use the `a0`/`a1` register-pair ABI. Enums containing a
Cell payload are local-only linear handles and cannot cross storage or entry
ABI boundaries. Dynamic, recursive, and generic payload ADTs fail before IR.
Quick syntax coverage pins exhaustive matching, dynamic rejection, and
arm-local linear discharge through the three `SCA-BUG-0.22-PAYLOAD-*` classes.

ProtocolGraph participant roles remain a derived audit view, never a verifier
or authorization condition. `actions[].protocol_role_candidates` preserves
the source of each candidate. A direct Address equality in a verification
predicate wins over witness/entry-witness or `lock_args` bindings, which win
over participant-like Address field names. Every candidate must carry
`evidence_tier = metadata-only` and `authorization_proven = false`; the
metadata validator rejects a `protocol-role` ProofPlan category. Graph edges
publish `role_source_used`, all candidates, and deterministic
`PG-ROLE-MISSING`, `PG-ROLE-WEAK-FIELD`, or `PG-ROLE-CONFLICT` lints. The quick
syntax gate pins the overclaim and conflict boundaries with the two
`SCA-BUG-0.22-PROTOCOLGRAPH-*` classes.

The top-level `capability_registry` is a closed, versioned audit contract.
Every `types[]` record carries the matching `capability_set_version`.
Composite operations emit `runtime.capability_proofs` with required, provided,
entailed, missing, identity-condition, capability-set-version, and
entailment-version fields. `destroy` is accepted by `consume + burn` (or a
labelled legacy compatibility alternative); `replace_unique` requires
`replace + identity-preservation`. Gates reject missing authority and any
attempt to borrow authority from another container/resource type. Quick syntax
coverage pins this with `SCA-BUG-0.22-CAPABILITY-OVERGRANT` and
`SCA-BUG-0.22-CAPABILITY-TRANSITIVE-GRANT`.

Bounded invariant quantifiers are finite-source declarations. Their ProofPlan
records use `bounded-source-quantifier`, identify the closed source view, and
record scan complexity, field reads, runtime cardinality, vacuous `forall`
status, and `u64` count overflow policy. Until a selected entry emits the named
bounded scan helper, their tier is `runtime-helper-required`, never
`checked-runtime` or `metadata-only`.

The explicit `ckb::require_bounded_cell_dep_data_hash` operation is a narrower
checked-runtime exception, not an automatic promotion of arbitrary
quantifiers. It has a compile-time `1..=64` bound, emits a real resolved
`Source::CellDep` `LOAD_CELL_BY_FIELD(DATA_HASH)` loop, and is covered by
positive/missing-dependency CKB-VM cases. Out point, dep type, and original
DepGroup identity remain manifest/builder evidence.

Bounded Cell collections use the same finite-evidence rule. An action may take
`input cells: BoundedCellSet<T, N>` and discharge its linear ownership exactly
once with `consume_each`. A fixed-width witness plan may use
`witness plans: BoundedList<P, N>` and exactly one `create` template per plan
element through `create_each`. `runtime.collection_instantiations` records the
explicit source, maximum cardinality, runtime-cardinality placeholder, vacuous
zero policy, and ownership. Consume iteration remains
`runtime-helper-required`; create iteration additionally emits
`builder-evidence-required` output-count and capacity obligations. The quick
syntax gate covers missing bounds, duplicate consumption, and
`Vec<Resource>` rejection.

Type validity uses one evidence contract across parser, type checking, IR,
metadata, ProofPlan, codegen, formatter, and LSP. A pure field predicate is
`checked-runtime` only when a concrete constructor/create instruction emits a
fail-closed guard before the output instruction on every selected create path.
`create_paths_selected` and `create_paths_checked` make partial coverage
auditable; partial, signature-only, or update paths without that lowering are
`runtime-helper-required`, and production gates must not promote them. Literal
`true` predicates may be `checked-static`.
`env::block_number()` is never treated as a compiler constant or an ambient
CKB-VM syscall: its record names both
`environment:env::block_number` and
`builder:header-dep-block-number-evidence`, with
`builder-evidence-required`. Every other `env::*` read fails closed. The quick
syntax audit requires positive evidence records and the unknown-environment
negative seed through `SCA-BUG-0.22-VALIDITY-EVIDENCE-MISSING` and
`SCA-BUG-0.22-VALIDITY-ENV-UNKNOWN`.

Explicit borrow blocks are a checked-static compiler contract. Each
`runtime.borrow_regions` record must use canonical `View<T>`, declare
`storage = none` and `abi = none`, and allow only `Pure` and `ReadOnly`
callees with a dedicated `&T` parameter. The matching `borrow-region`
ProofPlan entry records escape and root-lifecycle rejection. Quick syntax
coverage pins effect compatibility, escape rejection, and crossing
`consume`/`destroy` through the three `SCA-BUG-0.22-BORROW-*` classes.

## Command Cheatsheet

```bash
# Local fast path
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh dev

# Default CI/PR gate
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh ci

# Strict compiler-contract gate for backend work
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh backend

# Release-facing CKB production gate
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh release

# Compile-only release preflight; not external live/devnet evidence
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh release-quick
```

For scripted gate wrappers, the global `--json` flag selects one command result
on stdout for either success or failure. Structured failures carry their
category and exit code in addition to source ranges and diagnostic codes.
`--message-format=json` remains a hidden deprecated alias for compatibility.

The old release wrapper remains supported:

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_ckb_release_gate.sh quick  # delegates to cellscript_gate.sh release-quick
./scripts/cellscript_ckb_release_gate.sh full   # delegates to cellscript_gate.sh release
```

## Lower-Level Components

Use these only when you need a focused failure:

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_syntax_combo_audit.sh quick
./scripts/cellscript_syntax_combo_audit.sh ci
./scripts/cellscript_strict_backend_audit.sh quick
./scripts/cellscript_strict_backend_audit.sh ci
./scripts/cellscript_strict_backend_audit.sh full
./scripts/ckb_cellscript_acceptance.sh --production --stateful-scenarios
```

`./scripts/cellscript_0_14_scope_audit.sh` is a historical standalone audit
from the 0.14 release line. It is not invoked by any current gate mode and is
retained for manual 0.14-compat debugging only; it is not part of the 0.21
release-evidence boundary.

The following ecosystem/bridge scripts are standalone manual tools that are
**not** wired into any gate mode and are **not** part of the release-evidence
boundary. They require sibling checkouts (`../ckb`, `../CellFabric`) or external
runtimes and are documented in their respective guides for focused, opt-in use:

- `./scripts/cellscript_ckb_ecosystem_reuse_gate.sh` — CKB-ecosystem reuse
  checks; see `docs/CELLSCRIPT_CKB_ADAPTER.md`.
- `./scripts/cellscript_ckb_adapter_acceptance.sh` — adapter acceptance against
  a sibling CKB checkout; see `docs/CELLSCRIPT_CKB_STD_COMPAT.md`.
- `./scripts/cellscript_cellfabric_bridge_smoke.sh` — CellFabric bridge smoke
  test; see `docs/CELLSCRIPT_CELLFABRIC_BRIDGE.md`.

These must not be described as gating evidence, and passing one does not imply
any release-gate mode passed.

Passing one component does not imply the corresponding higher-level gate passed.
For example, CKB acceptance proves selected transaction behavior, while the
syntax-combination and strict backend audits prove compiler-layer edge cases and
structural invariants.

## Artifact Reports

The gates write machine-readable reports under `target/`:

- `target/syntax-combo-audit/`
- `target/cellscript-strict-backend-audit/`
- `target/ckb-cellscript-acceptance/`
- `target/cellscript-backend-shape/`
- `target/cellscript-schema-manifest/`

For release evidence, keep the JSON report paths in the release checklist rather
than copying long logs into review threads.

## CellScript Build Report

`scripts/ckb_cellscript_acceptance.sh --production` emits
`cellscript_build_reports` inside `target/ckb-cellscript-acceptance/` reports.
This is the exact-artifact bridge between compiler output, ELF ABI evidence,
and live CKB code-cell evidence. It does not replace the acceptance report,
production gate, or ELF entry ABI gate; it binds their artifact identities
together.

The top-level index is:

```text
cellscript_build_reports {
  schema = "cellscript-ckb-build-report-index-v0.20"
  status = "passed"
  artifact_count
  target_profile = "ckb"
  vm_profile = "ckb-vm"
  artifact_format = "riscv64-elf"
  artifact_hash_algorithm = "ckb-blake2b256"
  requires_exact_artifact_hash = true
  requires_elf_entry_abi_gate = true
  requires_live_code_cell_data_hash_match = true
  reports = [CellScriptBuildReport]
}
```

Each `CellScriptBuildReport` row records:

```text
CellScriptBuildReport {
  schema = "cellscript-ckb-build-report-v0.20"
  name
  kind
  source
  original_source
  example
  entry_flag
  entry
  target_profile = "ckb"
  vm_profile = "ckb-vm"
  artifact_format = "riscv64-elf"
  artifact_path
  metadata_sidecar
  artifact_packaging
  artifact_size_bytes
  artifact_hash_algorithm = "ckb-blake2b256"
  deployable_elf_hash
  artifact_sha256
  deployment_hash_type_used_by_gate = "data1"
  verify_artifact_status = "passed"
  verify_target_profile = "ckb"
  elf_entry_abi_status = "passed"
  abi_trailer_stripped = true
  onchain_deployments
}
```

For full devnet acceptance, every row must have at least one
`onchain_deployments` entry whose `live_code_cell_data_hash` equals
`deployable_elf_hash`. Compile-only production evidence keeps
`onchain_deployments` empty and is therefore not external release evidence.

Package identity must carry the same codec boundary explicitly. `Cell.lock`
`[package.build]`, `Deployed.toml` `[build]`, deployment records, and generated
builder identity checks include `cell_data_codec_manifest_hash` alongside
`artifact_hash`, `metadata_hash`, `schema_hash`, `abi_hash`, and
`constraints_hash`. Registry and builder verification fail closed when this
hash is missing or disagrees, so raw cell-data layouts cannot be hidden behind a
Molecule-only schema identity.
